# File Formats

## Common Terminology about Images & Formats

- **Resolution**: The number of pixels in an image, typically denoted as width x height (e.g., 1920x1080).
- **Aspect Ratio**: The ratio of the width to the height of an image.
- **Color Depth (Bit Depth)**: Refers to the number of bits used to represent the color of a single pixel. For example, an 8-bit image can display 256 colors per channel, while a 16-bit image can display 65,536 colors per channel, allowing for smoother gradients and more detailed color representation.
- **Compression**: The technique used to reduce the file size of an image. Lossy compression (like JPEG) reduces file size by removing some image data, while lossless compression (like PNG) reduces file size without losing any image data.
- **Alpha Channel**: A component of an image that represents transparency. Used in formats like PNG and EXR.
- **Dynamic Range**: The range between the darkest and lightest parts of an image. Higher dynamic range means more detail in shadows and highlights.
- **File Size**: The amount of storage space an image file requires. Influenced by resolution, color depth, and compression.

## JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)

JPEG is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. Since its introduction in 1992, JPEG has been the most widely used image compression standard in the world.

#### Use Cases:

- **Web and Digital Media**: JPEGs are commonly used for web content due to their efficient compression, which reduces file size and speeds up page loading times.
- **Compatibility**: Virtually every photo viewer, editing tool, and device in existence supports JPG files, making the format a safe choice for most applications.

### Key Characteristics of JPEG/JPG

#### Compression:

- **Lossy Compression**: JPEG uses lossy compression, which reduces file size by permanently discarding some image data. The degree of compression can be adjusted, balancing between image quality and file size.

- **Compression Ratio**: Typically, a high compression ratio (e.g., 20:1) results in smaller file sizes but lower image quality, while a low compression ratio (e.g., 5:1) maintains higher quality at the cost of larger file sizes.

- **Small file sizes**: Due to compression, JPEG files are generally smaller in size, reducing the download size of your application or game.

- **Fast loading times**: The small file sizes allow JPEG images to load quickly in web or mobile applications.

#### 24-bit Color Depth:

- **Channels**: JPEG images typically use three color channelsâ€”Red, Green, and Blue (RGB).
- **Bits per Channel**: Each channel in a standard JPEG image is allocated 8 bits.
- **Total Bit Depth**: With 8 bits per channel, the total bit depth for a JPEG image is 24 bits (8 bits for Red + 8 bits for Green + 8 bits for Blue).

Resulting in a total of 16.7 million possible colors. This 8-bit depth has been sufficient for most consumer and web-based applications due to its balance between image quality and file size.

#### No Alpha Channel:

JPEG does not support transparency. Images requiring transparency (alpha channel) need to use formats like PNG or GIF.

#### Disadvantages:

- **Lossy Compression**: JPEG compression results in data loss. Repeated saving of a JPEG file can degrade image quality over time, which is unsuitable for iterative edits.
- **Limited Editing Capabilities**: Not ideal for extensive post-processing due to compression artifacts and reduced color information.
- **No Transparency Support**: JPEGs cannot store transparency, making them unsuitable for images requiring alpha channels.

### More on bit depth

PNG (Portable Network Graphics) supports various bit depths, allowing for different levels of color precision and detail. Here's a breakdown of the bit depth options available in PNG:

#### 8-bit PNG / 32-bit PNG

- Commonly refers to 24-bit color images with an additional 8-bit alpha channel, providing transparency information. This format includes 8 bits each for red, green, blue, and alpha channels.
- Contains a palette of 256 colors, where each pixel references a color from a palette of 256 possible colors.
- Total bit depth for color and transparency is 32 bits per pixel.

#### 16-bit PNG / 64-bit PNG

- Refers to images with 16 bits per channel, resulting in a total of 48 bits for color representation (16 bits each for red, green, and blue).
- Total bit depth for color and transparency is 64 bits per pixel.
- Provides greater color precision and smoother gradients, which is beneficial for professional photography, digital art, and scientific imaging.

#### Integer vs. Floating Point

- **PNG**: Only supports integer values for bit depth (8-bit and 16-bit per channel). **It does not support floating point values.**

- **OpenEXR**: Supports both 16-bit and 32-bit floating point per channel, which allows for a much wider dynamic range and higher precision, making it ideal for HDR imaging and complex visual effects.
